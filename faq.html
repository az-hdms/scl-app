<h2>Why does this tool exist?</h2>
<p>Processing and doing quality-control on species occurrence data is a complex and time-consuming task. Over the years, we've developed internal tools that help us process data and spot errors more quickly. We've decided to share these tools to help you visualize your data, quickly spot errors in location and taxonomic information, and to help us maintain the highest-quality species observation database.</p>

<h2>How do my data get used by AGFD?</h2>
<p>Our Point Observation Database contains over 600,000 records of species occurrence data, and your data is vital to contributing to our knowledge about species distributions in Arizona. These data are used in a variety of managment and research contexts, such as project evaluation, environmental compliance, and planning monitoring efforts.</p>
