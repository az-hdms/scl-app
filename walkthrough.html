    <h2>Reviewing Data</h2>
    <p>There are several tools to help you review your data before you submit. You will find three tabs for viewing your data</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Overview (Map view)</li>
        <li>Quality Control</li>
        <li>View All Records</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Overview - Map view</h3>
    <p>The map view shows you where your uploaded data points fall on a map, represented as large blue map markers. You can click on individual markers to see basic information, and Seven adjust their location by dragging. In the marker popup window, click move, and then click and drag the (now red) marker to the correct location. When done, click the red marker, and click confirm. If you want to restore the original position, click cancel.</p>
    <p>In addition to the points you've just uploaded from the template, you can also view your past SCL report data, signified by small grey markers. It is also possible to filter all the marker by either species and/or year submitted.</p>
    <p>To the left of the map is some basic information on how many points have been uploaded, and how many have errors. To see the nature of the errors, please click the "Quality Control" tab at the top, just below the main navigation bar.</p>
    <h3>Quality Control</h3>
    <p>The most common errors are misspellings in taxonomy, and typos or missing digits in coordinates. Under the "Taxonomy" heading, we've provided a way to change all instances of a misspelled species name with suggested names (the left and right dropdown lists, respectively). Clicking "Change All" will replace the misspelling on the left with the selected value on the right.</p>
    <p>The "Coordinates/Others" section shows a table of all errors found within your data. This table is sortable by clicking on the table headers.</p>
    <h3>View All Records</h3>
    <p>This section of the application shows you a table of all of the records you uploaded. Any observations with detected errors in any of the field will be highlighted in red, with the specific field(s) highlight in darker red. You can filter this table to see only rows with errors bu clicking the checkbox that says "Show Only Errors?"</p>
    <p>It is possible to modify values directly from this table. Simply double click the value you want to change, and change accordingly. The application will update itself after each modification to this table, and if you have successfully corrected all errors on this table, the red highlights will be removed.</p>

    <h2>Fixing errors</h2>
    <p>We provide some tools inside the app (discussed above) to help visualize and adjust the values of your data fields. However, you are not required to perform these changes in the application. You can always adjust the values in your Excel template, and re-upload the corrected data at any time. Your data will not actually be submitted until you explicitly do so under the "Submit Data" tab in the main navigation bar.</p>

    <h2>Submit Data</h2>
    <p>When you are ready to actually submit your data, go to the "Submit Data" tab at the top of the page, highlight the appropriate permit and click "Submit Data.</p>

    <p>You also have the ability to submit data to the AGFD that is not related to your collecting license. Under the dropdown box, select the option "I am submitting data not related to my Scientific Collecting License". In this case, please add some brief descriptive text about the data you are submitting.</p>

    <h2>Nothing to Submit?</h2>
    <p>If you have nothing to submit on your SCL report, you can go directly to the "Submit Data" tab, select the appropriate permit number, and click the button that says Nothing To Submit.</p>
